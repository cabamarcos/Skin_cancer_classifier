# Skin Lesion Diagnosis System
## Introduction
In this practice, we will implement a system for diagnosing skin lesions based on dermatoscopic images.

Before delving into the practice, we will briefly describe the database we will use and the problem we aim to address.

Our objective is to implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that provides an automatic diagnosis of skin lesions from dermatoscopic images. Dermoscopy is a non-invasive technique that allows the evaluation of structures not visible to the naked eye, which specifically correlate with the histological properties of lesions. Identifying specific visual patterns related to color distribution or dermatoscopic structures can aid dermatologists in deciding on the malignancy of a pigmented lesion. The use of this technique greatly assists experts in supporting their diagnosis. However, the complexity of its analysis limits its application to experienced clinicians or dermatologists.

In our scenario, we will consider three classes of lesions:

Malignant Melanoma: Melanoma, also known as malignant melanoma, is the most common type of skin cancer and arises from pigment-producing cells known as melanocytes. Melanomas typically appear on the skin and rarely in other locations such as the mouth, intestines, or eye.

Seborrheic Keratosis: Seborrheic keratosis is a non-cancerous (benign) skin tumor that originates in the cells of the outer layer of the skin (keratinocytes), making it a non-melanocytic lesion.

Benign Nevus (Mole): A benign skin tumor originating from melanocytes (melanocytic).
